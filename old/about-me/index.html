            <h6 id="hello">Hello!</h6>

<p>I'm Muhammed ElRakabawi a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">front-end developer</a> from Egypt, I'm 19 years old studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology">biotechnological sciences</a> where we can re-engineer organism's genetic material (a.k.a <strong>DNA</strong>) to develop or make new products.</p>

<h4 id="chapteronework">Chapter one: Work!</h4>

<p><img src="../content/images/2016/11/liberio.gif" alt="I design with codes"></p>

<p>First  of all, i shall assume you were directed here from my <a href="https://elrakabawi.github.io">portfolio website</a> or just arrived here through Google or some sort of search engine.</p>

<p>So, i'll hurry up in that part. <br>
<strong>Ehhm</strong> (<em>clearing throat</em>):
I'm just another front-end web developer, i'm obsessed with user interaction design and web applications development. Every project starts with an initial <strong>idea</strong> that turns into <em>prototypes, mockups and wireframes</em> for the user experience design process then after everything is settled down, i start the <strong>development stage</strong> which includes visual design, coding and testing.</p>

<p>I rather prefer to call myself interaction designer, as i devote the most part of my work time to this stage of creating new ideas and different user experiences (it had been a problem for me since then, cause i didn't worked in client-based freelancing, i wanted more .. <strong>startups</strong>!)</p>

<p>I've been into Computer science and development since 2008, when i was 11 years old. I started to learn programming and security, i started with python, delphi and c#, Then i moved to PHP and Javascript. In 2014 i learnt algorithms and data structures in advanced structural C++ and joined the Egyptian Olympiads in informatics .. at April i got a bronze medal but i wasn't selected for continuing to the international olympiads.</p>

<p>These are my skills in Front-end development:</p>

<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong> :</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>Git </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DESIGN</strong> : </p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Illustrator, Fireworks</li>
<li>UI/UX design</li>
<li>UI Prototyping </li>
<li>Vector graphics</li>
<li>Typography </li>
</ul>

<p>Now you are not forced to continue if you came for the info above, but i grantee it's the most beautiful part.</p>

<p>I'm in love with <strong>science</strong>, specifically saying biological sciences (i.e Biomolecular sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry .. etc) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience">Computational neuroscience</a>.</p>

<p>This year when i was at my last high school year, i joined the first brain sciences competition ever in Egypt called <a href="http://alexneurocom.wixsite.com/brainbee">Egyptian Brain Bee</a> it was about neurobiology, anatomy, histology and psychological disorders. I was qualified to be one of the 10 winners that attended the final phase at Alexandria faculty of Medicine, but happily a friend was selected out of the ten to attend the final international competition, at that point my interest in neuroscience fired. I started in my own pet research in Theoretical(Computational) neuroscience about the technique of which neocortex(the part responsible for your sensory processing) applies to new informations.</p>

<p>On parallel, i grew interest for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics">Cytogenetics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology">Evolutionary biology</a> and Biological emergence, then i enrolled in faculty of biotechnology at my beloved <a href="http://www.msa.edu.eg/msauniversity/">university</a> to begin my learning journey. </p>

<p>I wish i could join some undergraduate research summer programs, to finish my studies, join a Biomolecular master degree program in Sweden(yes, Sweden is outstanding!) then work in one of these domains: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis">Abiogenesis</a>(Biochemistry research), Cytology genetics, Theoretical neuroscience.</p>
